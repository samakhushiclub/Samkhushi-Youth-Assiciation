Samakhushi Youth Association (Club) is a vibrant, community-driven, non-profit social club with roots stretching back nearly fifty years. Legally registered for over three decades, SYA has grown into a trusted and influential institution powered by energetic youth who volunteer their time, skills, and passion for community service.

Guided by transparency and democratic values, the Association elects its committee every four years through a General Assembly. All community works, events, and financial activities undergo an annual audit and are formally endorsed by the Assembly, ensuring accountability and trust.

Club is deeply woven into the social and cultural fabric of Samakhushi. The club actively supports local residents, connects them with local government bodies, assists in community development, and works tirelessly to maintain social harmony and cultural pride. Each year, SYA organizes a grand social picnic and various neighborhood programs that strengthen unity and collective spirit.

One of the Association’s proud achievements is its own club building, a symbol of long-term commitment and community ownership. Within this space, SYA operates a well-equipped gym and fitness center, promoting healthy lifestyles and providing accessible fitness opportunities to locals.

To safeguard heritage and uplift culture, the club also established “Saamaa Dhime Khala”, a Newari cultural group under the SYA umbrella. This troupe nurtures traditional music and dance, with young members performing in festivals, ceremonies, and cultural events—keeping the Newari rhythm and identity alive for future generations.

With decades of legacy and a renewed spirit of youth leadership, Samakhushi Youth Association continues to serve, inspire, and empower the community—today and for years to come.
